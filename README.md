# 12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This application creates an interface that displays employees, their roles and managers. Users are able to easily interact with the interface to add employees, departments, roles, view tables, and update existing roles. The application uses javascript and makes calls to the database using mysql. The application is displayed on the terminal where it is started.

## Installation Instructions

Download the files, make sure you have the correct dependecies installed


## Challenges

Making sure the different functions are being called correctly, including the query to the mysql connection. There are many actions the user can take. Therefore, it's good to have clean code and organize it in separate files. The sql queries did get complicated because if one table is changed, the other tables are affected. They are connected through ids.

## Usage Instructions

make sure node is installed, then run index.js, a prompt will be shown where the user will decide what actions to take.
